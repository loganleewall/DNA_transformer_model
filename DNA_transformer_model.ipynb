    "### What is DNABERT?\n",
    "DNABERT is a deep learning model that adapts the **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** architecture for DNA sequence analysis. DNA BERT takes in k-mers (DNA sequences split into groups of $k$ letters each) and outputs an embedding for each k-mer token.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The DNABERT-6 Architecture\n",
    "DNABERT-6 uses the same architecture as the original BERT model:\n",
    "* 12 transformer encoder layers\n",
    "* 768 hidden units per layer\n",
    "* 12 attention heads\n",
    "* ~110 million parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "DNABERT-6 adapts this architecture for DNA sequence data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How is DNABERT-6 trained?\n",
    "It is pre-trained on large amounts of unlabeled genetic data using k-mer tokenization, enabling it to capture both local and long-range dependencies in DNA.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is designed to be fine-tuned for various downstream tasks, such as promoter, splice site, or transcription factor binding site prediction, often with limited labeled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  How does DNABERT-6 tokenize DNA sequences?\n",
    "DNABERT-6 uses k-mer tokenization: each DNA sequence is split into overlapping substrings of length k (e.g., 6-mers for DNA_bert_6). For example, the sequence `ATGGCT` with k=3 becomes `ATG TGG GGC GCT`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DNABERT-6 tokenizer expects the input as a space-separated string of k-mers. The DNABERT-6 tokenizer may also add special tokens at the start and end of a sequence of k-mers: `[CLS]` at the start (for classification) and `[SEP]` at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example (DNABERT-6) with 3-mers:\n",
    "* Split the sequence `ATGGCT` into 3-mers: `\"ATG TGG GGC GCT\"`\n",
    "* Tokens: `[CLS], ATG, TGG, GGC, GCT, [SEP]`\n",
    "* Token IDs: `[101][1234][2345][3456][4567][102]` (example values)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the [CLS] token embedding and how is it used?\n",
    "The `[CLS]` token is a special token prepended to every input sequence by the DNA BERT Tokenizer. The `[CLS]` token's final hidden state (the encoder's output vector at position 0) is designed to represent the entire sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification tasks, the `[CLS]` embedding is typically fed into a classification layer (e.g., a linear layer) to predict the class label. This approach is explicitly described in the DNA BERT paper.\n",
    "\n",
    ">\"As illustrated in Figure 1b, for a DNA sequence, we tokenized it into a sequence of k-mers and added a special token `[CLS]` at the beginning of it (which represents the whole sequence) as well as a special token `[SEP]` at the end (which denotes the end of sequence).\"\n",
    "\n",
    ">Figure 1b caption: \"DNABERT uses tokenized k-mer sequences as input, which also contains a CLS token (a tag representing meaning of entire sentence), a SEP token (sentence separator) and MASK tokens (to represent masked k-mers in pre-training). The input passes an embedding layer and is fed to 12 Transformer blocks. The **first output among last hidden states will be used for sentence-level classification** while outputs for individual masked token used for token-level classification.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In code, if your hidden state tensor is `[batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size]`, then `hidden_state[:, 0, :]` gives you the `[CLS]` embedding for each sequence in the batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do we use BERT-based models for classification?\n",
    "Since the pretrained BERT models usually don't include a classification head by default, we can add our own layer (e.g., a linear or MLP layer) at the end of BERT-based model to make predictions using the `[CLS]` token's embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical workflow is:\n",
    "1. Tokenize and encode the sequence into a list of integer Token IDs.\n",
    "2. Pass through the model to get the hidden states.\n",
    "3. Extract the `[CLS]` embedding (`hidden_state[:, 0, :]`).\n",
    "4. Feed this embedding into your classification layer and train on your labeled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the standard approach for BERT-based models in both genomics and NLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What does the hidden state output of DNABERT look like?\n",
    "The model's output is a tensor of shape `[batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size]` (e.g., `[10, 512, 768]`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first dimension is the batch size, the second is the number of tokens passed as the input sequence to the DNABERT model (i.e. number of k-mers, up to the model's max length), and the third is the embedding size.\n",
    "\n",
    "To classify the sequence located at `batch_idx` in our batch, we use the vectors at position `[batch_idx, 0, :]` (the `[CLS]` token embedding) as the input to the classifier."

In this homework assignment, we won't actually be using the gene family as our `class`. Rather, we want to predict what species each DNA sequence comes from, so we will create our own `target` class based on whether this DNA sequence belongs to a chimpanzee, dog, or human.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's load them in as Pandas Dataframes. We'll create a `target` column based on the species the DNA comes from to use for prediction. Ideally, when training our classifier, we want our model to see an equal proportion of all the classes. The number of sequences (rows) in each txt file is not the same, so we need to create a combined dataset with an even class distribution (i.e. same number of examples for each species). We can calculate which species has the fewest DNA sequences, sample exactly that number of DNA sequences from all three species, and concatenate them together into a combined dataframe to use for training later!\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's walk through the process of turning a k-mer string into model-ready input, and explain each step and output along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Tokenizing k-mers with the DNABERT Tokenizer\n",
    "\n",
    "To prepare a k-mer string like the ones we generated with the `sequence_to_kmer` function into tokens we can pass into DNABERT, we use our tokenizer.\n",
    "* `return_tensors='pt'`: This tells the tokenizer to return PyTorch tensors instead of plain lists. This is necessary because the model expects tensor inputs.\n",
    "* `max_length=512`: Sets the maximum number of tokens in the sequence. If your sequence is longer, it will be cut off at 512 tokens. We need to set this `max_length` parameter because this is the maximum number of tokens that DNABERT was designed to handle in one forward pass.\n",
    "* `truncation=True`: Ensures that if your sequence is longer than max_length, it will be truncated (cut off) rather than causing an error\n",
    "* `padding='max_length'`: This tells the tokenizer to pad all sequences to exactly max_length tokens. If your sequence is shorter than 512 tokens, special padding tokens are added at the end so that every input is the same length. Neural network models (like DNABERT) work most efficiently when all inputs in a batch are the same size. But real-world text (or DNA) sequences can have different lengths. To process batches of sequences at the same time, we need to \"fill up\" shorter sequences so that they all have the same number of tokens as the longest sequence in the batch. Tokenizers use a special token called a padding token at the end of shorter sequences to ensure  the tokenized versions of all the sequences in a batch have the same length.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "tokens = tokenizer(kmer_string, return_tensors='pt', max_length=512, truncation=True, padding='max_length')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Understanding the Tokenizer Output\n",
    "The tokenizer returns a dictionary with several keys, but the most important are:\n",
    "* `input_ids`: The numerical IDs for each token in your input. Shape: `[batch_size, sequence_length]`(or `(1, 512)` for a single sequence).\n",
    "* `attention_mask`: A tensor of 1s and 0s indicating which tokens are real (1) and which are padding (0). The model uses the attention mask to \"mask out\" padding tokens so that it doesn't *attend* to padding tokens during processing, since the padding tokens don't actually hold useful information for us!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Passing Inputs to the Model\n",
    "To get embeddings from DNABERT, we pass both   `input_ids` and `attention_mask` to the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "outputs = model(input_ids=tokens['input_ids'], attention_mask=tokens['attention_mask'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Interpreting the Model Output\n",
    "Encoder-based transformer models from the HuggingFace Transformers library (like DNABERT-6) return a `transformers.modeling_outputs.BaseModelOutputWithPoolingAndCrossAttentions` object with several attributes. The most important for most tasks is:\n",
    "*  `last_hidden_state`: This is a tensor of shape `[batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size]` (e.g., `(1, 512, 768)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**What do these dimensions mean?**\n",
    "* `batch_size`: Number of sequences you processed at once (or 1 for a single example).\n",
    "* `sequence_length`: Number of tokens in your input (up to `max_length`).\n",
    "* `hidden_size`: The size of the embedding for each token (for DNABERT-6, this is 768).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row in `last_hidden_state` corresponds to the embedding for a token in your input sequence. The very first token (position 0) is the special `[CLS]` token, whose embedding is often used to represent the whole sequence for classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "If you print `last_hidden_state.shape` and see `(10, 512, 768)`, it means:\n",
    "* 10 sequences in the batch\n",
    "* 512 tokens (including `[CLS]`, k-mers, `[SEP]`, and possibly padding)\n",
    "* Each token is represented by a 768-dimensional vector\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code block below, we demonstrate how you can tokenize a single k-mer sequence, pass the tokens into a DNABERT model, and extract the final hidden state!\n"

    "BERT-based models (like BERT and DNABERT) are powerful at creating embeddings for sequences, but by default, they do not include a classification head—that is, a layer that turns those embeddings into class predictions for tasks like sequence classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "To turn those embeddings into actual predictions (for example, classifying whether a movie review is positive or negative, or predicting what species our DNA sequences come from), we need to add extra PyTorch modules for classification (usually one or more linear layers that we will train specifically for our classification task).\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do we use BERT-based models for classification?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the standard workflow for fine-tuning a BERT-based model like DNABERT on your own classification problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Tokenize and encode the sequence into a list of integer Token IDs\n",
    "    1. In our case, we need to convert our DNA sequence to k-mers, then use the pretrained tokenizer to turn these k-mers into a list of token IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Pass the token IDs through the BERT model to get the hidden states for each token in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Extract the `[CLS]` embedding.\n",
    "The hidden state at the `[CLS]` position (usually `hidden_state[:, 0, :]` for each sequence) is designed to “summarize” the information from the whole sequence. This contains the features we'll use for classification!\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Feed the `[CLS]` embedding into a classification layer.\n",
    "Add a trainable layer (like `nn.Linear(hidden_size, num_classes)` in PyTorch) on top of the BERT model to transform the `[CLS] embedding` into logits for our classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "During training, we'll train our classification head on our labeled data so that it learns how to turn the embeddings our BERT encoder produces into meaningful class predictions!\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is standard for all BERT-based models, whether we're working with DNA, RNA, or text in NLP! The classifier “head” learns to map the information-rich `[CLS]` embedding to your specific task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Backbone and Classification Heads\n",
    "In the context of models like BERT that have been adapted for classification tasks, the **backbone** refers to the main part of the neural network outputs useful embeddings/features from the original inputs.\n",
    "* Its job is to take in raw input (like a DNA sequence or a sentence), processes it through many layers, and produces a rich, high-level representation (embedding) of the input.\n",
    "* Key point: The backbone is usually pretrained on a large dataset and is good at understanding general patterns in the data, but it doesn't make final predictions for your specific task\n",
    "\n",
    "The **classification head** is the part of our adapted model specifically responsible for making predictions.\n",
    "* Its job is to take the features produced by the backbone (often the `[CLS]` token embedding) and turn them into predictions for our task.\n",
    "* Key point: The classification head is what actually makes the final decision or prediction, using the information the backbone has extracted.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, our **backbone** is a DNABERT-6 model, and our **classification head** will be the additional linear layers we add to predict what species the DNA comes from.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:** Implement a `Classifier` that combines a DNABERT as our backbone and a classification head.\n",
    "1. Define a linear layer as the model's classifier in the `__init__` method.\n",
    "2. In the `forward` method:\n",
    "    1. Pass the `input_ids` and `attention_mask` to the DNABERT backbone, and extract the DNABERT output's last hidden state.\n",
    "    2. Get the embeddings for the `CLS` token for each item in the batch.\n",
    "    3. Pass the `CLS` token embeddings to the `classifier` to produce logits.\n",
    "    4. Return the logits. Recall that we usually don't apply softmax to logits inside the model itself, because PyTorch's cross-entropy loss function will take the softmax of our logits when computing the loss.\n",

    "Let's create a custom DNA Dataset that will return the DNA kmers as tokenized inputs our DNABERT model can use for classification.\n",

    "    3. Since the tokenizer will return a batched output but `__getitem__` will return data for just a single sample, you should extract the `input_ids`from the tokenizer output and reshape it from shape `(1, 512)` into `(512)`.\n",
    "    4. Likewise, extract `attention_mask` from the tokenizer output and reshape it from `(1, 512, 512)` into `(512, 512)`.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Notes about batching:**\n",
    "* When we use the DNABERT tokenizer with `return_tensors='pt'`, it returns tensors with a batch dimension, even if you only tokenize a single sequence.\n",
    "    * For example, `input_ids` will have shape `(1, max_length)` and `attention_mask` will have shape `(1, max_length, max_length)`. Notice how the first dimension, which corresponds to the batch size, has a value of 1 to represent that we tokenized just a single sequence!\n",
    "* When we use a DataLoader to create batches, it will automatically stack multiple samples from the Dataset together along a new batch dimension. If you leave the batch dimension in each sample, you'll end up with an extra, unwanted dimension (e.g., (batch_size, 1, max_length) instead of (batch_size, max_length)). So if we don't remove the batch dimension in the `__getitem__` method of our Dataset, we'll get shape mismatches during training."

    "Let's take the DNA classification model we just trained and apply it to our class Kaggle competition! Your homework folder should include a file called `dna_test.txt`, which contains 1377 DNA sequences. In the cell below, we've written a helper function for you that loads the `dna_test.txt` file, makes predictions for each DNA sequence, and saves the predictions to a csv file called `dna_test_predictions.csv`.\n",
